# Get_next_line

In this project i've built a program which kind of works like the readline from c++, the program contains a static variable which holds a BUFFER_SIZE of data, and each time you call the program it gets the next line of in the file

usage: `open a file descriptor, compile the programme and define the buffer size (gcc *.c -DBUFFER_SIZE=<number>)`
